## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used no other outside sources, only the information and steps presented through the pre-work instructions.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
    When creating this submission, I had to really focus and play around with various elements to get everything organized and retrieve the necessary elements asked for in the instructions. For starters, I had used GitHub a while back but was reintroduced to it due to this entertaining and informative project. The vide guides presented in the instructions were very helpful in getting me situated with GitHub's format and layout again, however I struggled a little with it came to using the GitHub Desktop app and attempting to Commit and Push files. Eventually, I reread instructions more carefully and went at a slower pace to fully understand everything. Creating the project itself on Glitch was actually very fun. I have never used that platform before nor have coded in that language (I've seen friends and other students writing things on on JavaScript before), so using my knowledge that I have from using IntelliJ and seeing some similarities popping up between the two was very satisfying and made me feel confident that with more practice I could really master this language. After completing said project, the app I tried to use (Recordit) was not opening or working properly so I ended up using LICEcap instead and created 2 gifs of my game working and uploaded it to the README. Recording my 5 minute interview went over very easily and I enjoyed discussing the topic questions. Overall, everything went well and I hope that I was able to successfully submit things.   

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    Concerning web development, this project was the first time I ever attempted something like it, so there was a level of concern and doubt going in. After having done the project, I was pleasantly surprised at how straight-forward and not super convoluted things were. I was actually able to understand why things acted a certain why, what my actions and specifications in the code were affecting in the final outcome, and it gave me a sense of wonder as to what countless other things I could. I'm very intrigued in web development now because of this, and would love to learn so much more (not just making little games, but functioning websites and apps that serve other purposes as well). 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
    If I committed more time into this project, I would've loved to have implemented some new buttons, sounds, game modes, or rules/limitations to really challenge the player during the game.  I thought of adding another button or two with different colors or maybe even shapes to help the player differentiate between all the buttons more easily (as well as try and see how different shapes could be made in the code). Instead of just a frequency sound, maybe I could've attempted to change it around to play a distinct note of an instrument, or even a phrase/spoken word. Finally, implementing a blitz mode where one had to guess within a time frame or as fast and as accurately as they could would have definitely been the next thing I would've attempted to add.
